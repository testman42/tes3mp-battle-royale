# TES3MP Battle Royale Prototype

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-spaghetti-orange.svg)](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_172856_HvF2J.jpg)

Battle Royale game mode for TES3MP 0.7.0-alpha.

This is far from finished, so I won't write anything useful here for now.

testBR.lua is the file with all the code, and some custom spells and map tiles which are neede for code to work are also provided.

And some changes have to be made in config.lua, for example chhanging the default respawn point, disable resting, etc.

Feel free to look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/testman42/tes3mp-battle-royale/projects/1) for the project.

Any kind of [feedback or criticism](https://github.com/testman42/tes3mp-battle-royale/issues/new/choose) is welcome.
